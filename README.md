# asthmaMap
## Interactive asthma prevalence map for NYC <br/>
*Demo with FAKE data.  All numbers used here are randomly generated.* <br/>
**Instructions:** <br/>
   - Choose to color the choropleth map by either asthma rate, numerator (for raw magnitude of asthma burden), or denominator (for underlying patient population). <br/>
   - Select any combination of Sex, Age, and Race, as well as Asthma Diagnosis. <br/>
   - 'Any' Asthma Diagnosis overrides Asthma Severity.  Asthma Severity can only be used as a selector if Asthma Dx 'by Severity' is chosen. <br/>
   - Note that due to a quirk of the data source, 'Any' Asthma Dx is not identical to having all Asthma Severity toggles selected. <br/>
   - Hover over a neighborhood (these are United Hospital Fund neighborhoods) to see num/den/rate for that neighborhood, based on selected toggles. <br/>
   - Click a neighborhood to see a side-by-side barchart comparison between asthma prevalence for that neighborhood and the overall NYC rate (again, based on selected toggles.)
